**SET**
In C++, a set is a standard template library (STL) container that stores unique elements in a sorted order. 
It is implemented as a binary search tree, typically a red-black tree. The key characteristic of a set is that it does not allow duplicate elements.
By default,set is sorted in ascending order.
The time complexities for doing various operations on sets are:

Insertion of Elements – O(log N)
Deletion of Elements – O(log N)
